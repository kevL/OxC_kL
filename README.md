OxC_kL
======

a liberal adaptation of openXcom

See: https://github.com/SupSuper/OpenXcom


Many contributers both acknowledged and unacknowledged to code and modified resources.

Nothing here has any guaranteed compatibility in any way shape or form with OpenXcom or any of its modifications -- regard this as a simple personal library and a way for me to fool around with GitHub.

The branch "oXc_kL" is my fork of OpenXcom.

The repository is substantially different than SupSuper's original. It will not merge automatically. I build it on a Windows XP 32-bit system. I do not maintain cmakes etc. or particularly care about cross-platform capability. That said, I do not purposely take out the latter (only the former).
