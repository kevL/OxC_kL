a liberal adaptation of openXcom

See: https://github.com/SupSuper/OpenXcom


Many contributers both acknowledged and unacknowledged to code and modified resources.

See: http://openxcom.org/forum/index.php


Nothing here has any guaranteed compatibility in any way shape or form with OpenXcom or any of its modifications -- regard this as a simple personal library and a way for me to fool around with GitHub.
