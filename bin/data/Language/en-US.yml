  STR_LASER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "THIS CONVENTIONAL LASER BEAM IS POWERED BY AN ANTI-MATTER REACTION CHAMBER."
  STR_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: "THE GRAVITY BEAM DIRECTS A FINELY CHANNELED IMPLODING GRAVITY FIELD."
  STR_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: "The Sectoid hierarchy ranges from soldiers to leaders with powerful psionic abilities. These psionic powers can be used to demoralize soldiers in combat, or even take control of their minds. They tend to indulge in human abductions and cattle mutilation. The abduction is used to extract genetic material for cross breeding and developing clones for infiltrating human society. The cattle provide both nutrition and genetic material. This race appears to want to develop superior genetic hybrids to increase the efficiency of their hive-like society."
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY: "Sectoid autopsy"
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The autopsy reveals vestigial digestive organs and a simple structure. The brain and eyes are very well developed. The structure suggests genetic alteration or mutation. The small mouth and nose appear to have little function. The webbing between the fingers, and the flat feet suggest aquatic origins. There are no reproductive organs, and no clues as to how this species can reproduce. They are most probably a genetically engineered species."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This race developed in an extremely hostile environment. They are extremely tough and can resist extreme temperature variations. Their mobility depends on a snake-like giant 'foot' which protects all the vital organs. Their objectives appear to be purely predatory and they appear to be under the command of some other intelligence which directs their military-style incursions on earth."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY: "Snakeman autopsy"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The skin is extremely tough and heat resistant. The cardio-vascular system is part of the muscular system which uses the hydraulic principle to create motion. The only true muscle is the 'heart'. The reproductive system appears to be very efficient. Reproduction is asexual, with each snakeman carrying up to fifty eggs inside its body at any one time. Left to its own devices this species would be a severe threat to life on earth."
  STR_ETHEREAL_UFOPEDIA: "This being has awesome mental powers which allow for telepathic communication and telekinetic abilities. The apparently weak physical abilities of this creature are sustained by its mental powers. We do not understand how these telekinetic powers work, since they seem to defy the laws of physics as we know them. They are extremely dangerous in any combat situation, where they rely on their mental powers for combat. They rarely appear on earth since they seem to rely on other races to pursue their objectives."
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY: "Ethereal autopsy"
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This being is physically retarded and seems incapable of sustaining any life functions. The muscles are severely atrophied and the internal organs appear to be under-developed. The sensory organs, including the eyes, do not appear to function at all. The brain, however, is well developed and draws on a high proportion of the body's blood supply. It is a mystery as to how this creature can sustain itself without external support."
  STR_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: "This humanoid creature is physically powerful and intelligent. They have a particular appetite for consuming raw flesh of any kind, which they need for sustenance like earth based carnivores. They appear to rely on telepathic commands from a race known as 'Ethereals'. Once separated from this telepathic link their mental system appears to break down and they die. The cybernetic implants are used to enhance their combat performance. They are clearly the foot soldiers for a higher intelligence."
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY: "Muton autopsy"
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The 'skin' of this creature appears to be an organically created protective armor which is grafted onto the body. There are numerous cybernetic implants which are used to enhance the cardio-vascular system and the senses. The reproductive organs appear to have been surgically removed. Evidently these unfortunate creatures are limited to a life of warfare and conquest. Armor piercing ammunition is not very effective against their toughened skin."
  STR_CELATID_UFOPEDIA: "This life-form has the mysterious natural ability to float through the air. It appears to detect human brain waves and will move towards a human target even if well hidden. Once a target is detected the Celatid lands and fires small globules of extremely corrosive venom. The creature has the ability to clone itself at an alarming rate. It accompanies the Muton race in its wanderings."
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY: "Celatid autopsy"
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The core contains a small bio-mechanical device which appears to be a naturally evolved anti-gravity propulsion system. The sac of venom is the largest organ and there does not appear to be a separate brain structure. There is no discernible digestive or reproductive system. A small organ contains embryos which can grow rapidly into a new being."
  STR_SILACOID_UFOPEDIA: "This silicon based life form generates an enormous amount of heat. It has the strength to crush rocks which can then be ingested by the hot core. It has a primitive intelligence and can be controlled by implants or telepathic beings. It works with the Muton aLien race."
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY: "Silacoid autopsy"
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The core of the creature is extremely hot, and seems to be the basis for a digestive system. Its unique muscle system has tremendous power and speed. Its rock-like skin is not harmed by fire or incendiary ammunition."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA: "The crab-like claws of this creature are a powerful weapon in close combat. The high metabolism and strength of this creature give it speed and dexterity. Instead of killing its victim it impregnates it with an egg and injects a venom which turns it into a walking zombie. A new Chryssalid will burst from the victim shortly after impregnation. Chryssalids are associated with the Snakeman race."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY: "Chryssalid autopsy"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The exo-skeleton of this creature is extremely tough, but surprisingly vulnerable to explosive ammunition. The brain is well developed, and its cell growth rate very fast. The creature carries twenty eggs which are laid inside other organisms. This creature is a very effective terror weapon."
  STR_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "The Floaters are primarily soldiers and terror agents. They are naturally predatory beasts, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced to make formidable warriors. The lower half of the body and most internal organs are surgically removed, and a life support system is installed. This implant contains an anti-gravity unit which enables the creature to float, albeit unsteadily, through the air."
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY: "Floater autopsy"
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature has been drastically altered by surgery. The device which seems to form the core of the body is a life support system, taking over the function of heart, lungs and digestive system. This would enable the creature to survive in extremely hostile environments. The brain is smaller than ours, but the sensory organs are well developed."
  STR_REAPER_UFOPEDIA: "This bipedal carnivore has powerful jaws and a voracious appetite. It has a number of brain implants which are used to control its activity. The primitive predatory instincts of this creature are of little use except to terrorize and destroy. Reapers are commonly associated with Floaters."
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY: "Reaper autopsy"
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Reaper contains two 'brains' and two 'hearts' which allow it to function even when heavily wounded. However, its furry skin is highly flammable, making the creature vulnerable to incendiary weapons."
  STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectopods are robot creatures with a powerful plasma beam weapon. The control of these mechanical beasts is via a telepathic link to their controllers, the Ethereals. Sectopods are the most powerful terror weapon available to the aLien forces."
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY: "Sectopod autopsy"
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The robot is sturdily constructed with powered armor capable of resisting most forms of attack, in particular plasma weapons. However, the sensing circuitry seems particularly vulnerable to laser weapons."
  STR_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature flying saucer is an automated terror weapon armed with a powerful plasma beam. The anti-gravity propulsion gives it a big advantage in difficult terrain. Its primary function is destruction and terror in the service of the Sectoid race."
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY: "Cyberdisc autopsy"
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Cyberdisc is well shielded and is particularly good at withstanding explosive ammunition. The primary anti-gravity system is too badly damaged to gain any understanding of its functioning."
  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The power source of aLien craft is an anti-matter reactor which uses Elerium (element-115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy. The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Elerium can produce a huge amount of power. This unit can be reproduced easily using aLien alloys."
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "aLien craft use sophisticated computers to navigate on earth and through space. The system is based on optical processors arranged in network fashion. The control interface is relatively simple - the navigator controls the direction of gravity waves generated by the power source to move the craft in any direction. This system can be used easily by humans, and it can be reproduced using aLien alloys and other components."
  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "aLien craft consist of three main components - a power source, a navigation system and a hull built from aLien alloys. The hull is specially designed to allow gravity waves to be directed and controlled. In addition a small quantity of ELERIUM is required to fuel the power source. Once the principles of construction are understood, and the functions of each component are known, then it is possible to build these types of craft."
  STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: "These chambers contain various enzymes which are used to digest the body parts of cattle, other animals and even humans. The liquid is then consumed as ready digested food - probably direct to the bloodstream. This suggests a certain dependence on earth for food - a symbiosis between earth and aLien society."
  STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "These chambers contain aLien fetuses. The design of these containers seems to suggest that the aLiens which use this process rely completely on laboratory reproduction. The rich nutrients ensure rapid development of the fetus. This factory line system could generate thousands of aLien clones in a short space of time. The process could be easily adapted for human reproduction, or aLien-human hybrids."
  STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The most likely function of these spheres is recreational. The psionic circuitry stimulates various centers of the brain. The effect is similar to hallucinogenic drugs. This is the only evidence that aLiens have any cultural or recreational pastimes."
  STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: "This surgical equipment uses laser cutters to extract certain body parts from cattle and other animals. The widespread cattle mutilations can be accounted for by this bizarre aLien activity. It is likely that these parts are used for nutritional or genetic purposes."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "In the past many thousands of people have claimed to have been abducted by aLiens, sometimes repeatedly. The truth is far more horrific. Humans are abducted, researched and monitored. The best specimens have genetic material extracted. Women have human-aLien hybrid fetuses implanted, and then removed several months later. Who knows what sinister motives the aLiens have ...?"
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "aLien craft are constructed from special alloys with unique properties. They are extremely light and durable, and can be molded by electro-magnetic methods. This material can be reproduced and used in many kinds of manufacturing processes."
  STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "This element has the unusual property of generating anti-matter power when bombarded with certain particles. This creates gravity waves and other forms of energy. It is not naturally found in our solar system and cannot be reproduced."
  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that we are fighting a losing battle on earth. The aLien hordes are overwhelming in number. The best we can do is slow down their progress. The only hope for humanity is to tackle the aLiens at their source. Our research seems to indicate a nearby base of operations within our solar system. aLiens indicate this place to be the center of an ancient civilization that pre-dates human history. We must locate this place as soon as possible. However, we need to capture and interrogate an aLien leader to gain more detailed information. The larger UFOs probably contain at least one aLien Leader."
  STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our research now points to Mars as the base of aLien operations. The base is well hidden, and contains all the manufacturing and cloning facilities to fuel the infiltration of earth. It also seems to contain a controlling computer of some kind that controls the whole operation. It seems that the hive-like aLien society has some kind of 'queen bee'. This is their fundamental weakness - if we can eliminate the 'brain' then the body will die. We must step up our research efforts before it is too late. In order to progress we must capture the highest ranking aLiens - the Commanders - which only reside in aLien bases."
  STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA: "It is now clear that the aLien hordes are being controlled from an underground base in Cydonia - which is an unusual area of Mars featuring five-sided pyramids and a large formation resembling a human face. Cydonian civilization once flourished on Mars many millions of years ago, but we do not know why it died out, or what the connection is with the latest aLien activity there. Whatever the explanation we must send an expedition to Cydonia. This is the only way that we can defeat the aLiens. We must destroy the controlling Master Brain. We will need an Avenger craft equipped with the most awesome destructive power at our disposal. There is nothing more we can learn here - we must await the outcome of the Cydonian assault."

The combination of high fire power and strong armor makes these units valuable for open terrain fire fights. Make sure that there are sufficient cannon shells in your stores to re-arm tanks. They are armed automatically when you assign them to a squad."
  STR_TANK_ROCKET_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This automated Heavy Weapons Platform is armed with powerful rockets. This will be devastating for any aLien foe. Make sure your stores are kept supplied with HWP rockets."
  STR_TANK_LASER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Laser weapons are a useful addition for HWPs. It combines heavy firepower with no ammunition restrictions."
  STR_HOVERTANK_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "aLien technology has given the HWP a new lease of life. The added maneuverability of air travel and the power of plasma beams is a lethal combination."
  STR_HOVERTANK_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This hovertank has a fusion ball launcher that is capable of immense devastation. Use it with great care. You will have to manufacture the fusion balls to keep these HWPs fully armed. A fusion ball is an intelligent guided weapon. In order to fire it select a number of way-points with the cursor and then click on the 'launch' icon to fire the fusion ball."
  STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device is used as ammunition for a Plasma Heavy Gun. It contains a small quantity of Elerium."
  STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This small object is used as a power source for a Plasma Rifle - a medium powered aLien weapon. Contains a small quantity of Elerium."
  STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "Power source for the small aLien Plasma Pistol. Contains Elerium - the source of all aLien power."
  STR_STUN_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "The Stun Bomb is used for capturing live human specimens, but it can also be used against most aLien races. It is fired from a Stun Launcher."
  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The aLien research mission is used for collecting basic data on earth and its inhabitants. Small vehicles are predominantly used, with occasional landings in deserted areas. This type of aLien activity poses the least threat to xCom, with little concern from governments or the public."
  STR_ALIEN_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "The aLiens have many uses for earth's fauna. Animals are abducted secretly, and returned with various organs removed. Cattle mutilations are predominantly reported along with uFo sightings. This type of aLien activity causes great concern for governments and considerable anxiety amongst the population. This type of activity occurs mainly in farming land. The theory behind the 'aLien harvest' suggests that aLien races originally 'seeded' the planet with its flora and fauna, and now they have returned to reap the harvest they have sown."
  STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "This is the most insidious form of aLien activity. The abduction by aLiens is widely reported, despite the aLiens' attempts to erase the experience from their victims' memories. Abductees report being subject to humiliating physical examinations, including impregnation of aLien fetuses and bizarre genetic experiments. The purpose behind this activity appears to be linked to genetic mutation and manipulation of the aLiens' own genetic material. This activity causes great alarm, and occurs in populated areas or cities."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Earth governments can be infiltrated by aLien agents which are human in appearance. This can result in official contact between aLiens and governments at the highest level. The climax of this activity is characterized by intense uFo activity in the vicinity of major cities. The aLiens will attempt to sign a pact with an earth government by offering knowledge of their superior technology. In return the government will allow the aLiens to conduct their activity unhindered. This aLien mission represents the worst threat to xCom. If a government agrees to a pact then its funding will cease."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA: "aLiens will construct secret underground bases in remote locations. After some initial reconnaissance flights some intense uFo activity will occur as the base is being built. These bases are known to contain experimental labs for human abductees, and supplies for further activity in the region. The presence of aLien bases will generate a large amount of reported aLien activity without the presence of UFOs. In order to locate a base an xCom craft must patrol an area for a few hours to stand some chance of detection."
  STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA: "When the aLiens terrorize a city they will deploy some special forces with awesome powers. Civilians will be directly threatened, and governments will be forced to evacuate whole areas. The main purpose behind this activity is to generate sufficient public hysteria so that governments will threaten the xCom project."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If xCom interceptors are being particularly successful in shooting down UFOs then the aLiens may take some retaliatory action. This could result in a direct attack against an xCom base. However, the aLiens have to find an xCom base in order to attack it, and provided UFOs are kept away then there should be little danger of an assault."
  STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once an aLien base is constructed then it is resupplied on a regular basis by a special supply vessel. If one of these vessels is detected while landing then it is certain that an aLien base is nearby."
  STR_SMALL_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "This tiny craft is primarily used for reconnaissance or research. It normally precedes larger vessels at the start of an aLien mission."
  STR_MEDIUM_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "A medium sized scout vessel that poses little threat to earth forces. Normally appears before larger vessels during missions."
  STR_LARGE_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "The largest aLien scout craft is a general purpose vessel that is used in all types of aLien mission."
  STR_HARVESTER_UFOPEDIA: "The harvester has a trap door in its base and is equipped with lifting gear to haul up cattle or other beasts. Laser cutters are used to extract the desired material and the carcass is dumped on the ground. There are also storage containers for body parts."
  STR_ABDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This vessel is equipped with an examination room for performing horrific experiments on human subjects. The victim is normally paralyzed by telepathic powers, but remains conscious while on the operating table."
  STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The terror ship has a containment facility for large aLien terror weapons or creatures. It is used to transport these aLien terrorists into populated areas."
  STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The battleship is the largest and most powerful aLien craft. It is normally the primary aLien mission craft, equipped with powerful weapons and numerous crew members."
  STR_SUPPLY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The supply vessel is used during the construction of aLien bases or for supplying existing bases. It carries aLien food containers and reproduction chambers."
