--VOCABULARY--

MCD = Map CoDe.  Every type of tile has its own entry in on of the MCD
      Files

PCK = picture PaCK.  It stores all of the images associated with the
      terrain type.  Each PCK is associated with a TAB file, which
      gives offsets (TABs) into the file for the graphics drawing to
      use.

LOFTEMPS = Line Of Fire TEMPlateS.  They determine where a bullet
           traveling through the object will collide.  There are 12
           LOFTemps in every tile, one for each of twelve levels.

ScanG = Scanner Graphic.  This refers to the image shown when you view
        the overhead map of the battle.



--USING THE PROGRAM--

Before running, you should edit FILELIST.TXT

Each line in the file has a path to a certain file.  Change the
directories to the corresponding file on your computer, if you have
it.  If not, leave it out.

EXAMPLE:
FILELIST.TXT contains the line
c:\games\ufo\terrain\barn

Enemy Unkown (UFO) is installed at d:\mps\ufo\ on this computer.
Change the line to:
d:\mps\ufo\terrain\barn

To add more files to one set of files, add one to the leading number


Once the program is running, you can select a file or change the
filename in the textbox.

Clicking on the "List" button will bring up a list of possible terrain
types in the same directory as the one you currently have selected.

Click on the "Load MCD" button to load the tile information for the set
you have selected.  Make sure to click on "Load PCK" if you want to
see the tiles correctly!

Click on the "Load LOFT" button to load the Line Of Fire Templates.
You only need to load these once, or if you're changing from one game
to another (EU->TFTD or vice versa).

Click on the "Load PCKs" button to load the graphics for the current
tileset.

Click on the "Load ScanGs" button to load the Scanner Graphics.  Like
the LOFTs, you only need to do this once or if you're switching games.

Click on the "SAVE MCD" to save all of the changes you have made to
the MCD set.  MAKE BACKUPS FIRST!

Click on the "See Graphics" button to view (and edit) the graphics you
have loaded.

Clicking on the "LOF >>" button will draw an isometric view of the
LOFTEMPs selected for this tile.

Clicking on "PCK 1>>" button will animate the tile the number of times
listed in the "Reps:" box.

Clicking on "PCK 2>>" button will animate the tile, at double size,
the number of times listed in the "Reps:" box.

Click on a LOFTemps image, PCK Animation frame, or the Scanner Graphic
to select a new LOFTemp image, PCK, or ScanG for the tile.

Click on "<<" or ">>" to browse through the tiles.




--EDITING GRAPHICS--

To edit graphics, load the graphics and then click on "See Graphics".

Left clicking on the LOFTemps, PCKs, or ScanGs will copy that image
to the clipboard.  Right clicking will paste from the clipboard to
the image.

To save an image, click on the corresponding "Save" button.

NOTE:  It will save as the last file loaded from, not necessarily
       the filename entered in the textboxes on the main window!
