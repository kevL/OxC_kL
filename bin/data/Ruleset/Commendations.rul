# Ruleset for diary and commendations mod
# When stats reach the criteria threshold, the commendation is awarded
# Any vector greater than 10 will require more strings and more sprites decorations.
# Commendations may have multiple criteria.
# List of possible criteria:
#   totalKills
#   totalMissions
#   totalWins
#   totalScore
#   totalStuns
#   totalDaysWounded
#   totalBaseDefenseMissions
#   totalTerrorMissions
#   totalNightMissions

#   totalLowAccuracyHits
#   totalReactionFire
#   totalTimesWounded
#   totalValientCrux

# The following criteria use a hardcoded noun for the name/description.
# They are INCOMPATIBLE with eachother. If used together,
# the commendation will be given out repeatedly.
#   totalKillsWithAWeapon
#   totalMissionsInARegion
#   totalKillsByRace
#   totalKillsByRank
# The following criteria allow more control over the kinds of kills that can be awarded.
# To use, you must define a killCriteria.
# The killCriteria can list any race, rank, weapon, ammo, 
# or one of these statuses: STATUS_DEAD and STATUS_UNCONSCIOUS,
# or one of these factions: FACTION_HOSTILE, FACTION_NEUTRAL, FACTION_PLAYER
# or one of these battle types: BT_FIREARM, BT_AMMO, BT_MELEE, BT_GRENADE, BT_PROXIMITYGRENADE, BT_MEDIKIT, BT_SCANNER, BT_MINDPROBE, BT_PSIAMP, BT_FLARE, BT_CORPSE
# or one of these damage types: DT_AP, DT_IN, DT_HE, DT_LASER, DT_PLASMA, DT_STUN, DT_MELEE, DT_ACID, DT_SMOKE
# Use the strings from the ruleset to define them (mods can be used too). 
# For example, look at "STR_MEDAL_BOLTS_CROSS_NAME". It is awarded if a soldier
# stuns one hostile commander or stuns one hostile leader.
#   killsWithCriteriaCareer 
#   killsWithCriteriaMission
#   killsWithCriteriaTurn
# It is possible to reduce the amount of awards a commendation gets, but still reaching
# the triple gold star decoration. To do this, repeat the numbers in the criteria vector.
# For example, [5, 10, 20, 20, 20, 20, 40, 40, 40, 40] will have one award for 5, will have a 
# second award for 10 (bronze star), will have a third award for 20 (2 silver stars) and 
# will have a fourth award for 40 (3 gold stars).
